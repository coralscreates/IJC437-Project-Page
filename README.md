## Project: What are the characteristics that predict Song Popularity?
### Background Conext
Music is an influential and important part of many cultures and societies, bringing people from different backgrounds and identities together.  The music industry is continuously evolving, particularly through digitalisation which has increased music consumption, global influence and revenue. Song popularity is commonly used as an indicator of musical success and often reflects performance across multiple components, such as sales and chart rankings. For artists and industry stakeholders, understanding the characteristics that contribute to song popularity is increasingly important.

**Three main questions were explored to answer the question:**
1. Do acoustic features predict song popularity?
2. Does song type (collobrative or solo songs) predict song popularity?
3. Does artist type predict song popularity?

### Methodology

## How To Run The Code
There are two options to run the code
### Option 1: Using The Pre-Merged And Cleaned Dataset
1. Download the **"dataset_songs.csv"** file onto your laptop.
2. Download the **"IJC437 final pre-merged code .r"** file and open it in RStudio
3. Import the **"dataset_songs.csv"** file into RStudio (following Step 1 in the R script)
4. Run the script from Step 1 to the end to run the code and complete the analysis 
   
### Option 2: Merging The Raw CSV Files
1. Download the relevant files onto your laptop:
   - **"official_songs_cleaned.csv"**
   - **"official_is_pop_cleaned.csv"**
   - **"acoustic_features.csv"**
   - **"artists_cleaned .csv"**
3. Download the **"IJC437 final code .r"** file and open it in RStudio
4. Follow each step in the script to merge the files and complete the analysis
