## Project: What are the characteristics that predict Song Popularity?
### Background Conext
Music is an influential and important part of different cultures and societies, bringing people from different backgrounds and identities together.  The music industry is continuously evolving, particularly through digitalisation which has increased music consumption, global influence and revenue. Song popularity is commonly used as an indicator of musical success and often  reflects performance across multiple components, such as sales and chart rankings. For artists and industry stakeholders, understanding the characteristics that contribute to song popularity is increasingly important.

Three main questions were explored to answer the question:
1. Do acoustic features predict song popularity?
2. Does song type (collobrative or solo songs) predict song popularity?
3. Does artist type predict song popularity?
