## Project: What are the characteristics that predict Song Popularity?
### Background Conext
Music is an influential and important part of many cultures and societies, bringing people from different backgrounds and identities together.  The music industry is continuously evolving, particularly through digitalisation which has increased music consumption, global influence and revenue. Song popularity is commonly used as an indicator of musical success and often reflects performance across multiple components, such as sales and chart rankings. For artists and industry stakeholders, understanding the characteristics that contribute to song popularity is increasingly important.

Three main questions were explored to answer the question:
1. Do acoustic features predict song popularity?
2. Does song type (collobrative or solo songs) predict song popularity?
3. Does artist type predict song popularity?

### Methodology 
- Excel to clean the data
- R studio to run Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA), Linear Regression Models and Random Forest Models.
- Libraries used: tidyverse, ggplot2, MASS, rgl corrplot and randomForest (make sure that these are all downloaded)
  

### Key findings
- A
- B
- C

## How To Run The Code
There are two options to run the code
### Option 1: Using The Pre-Merged And Cleaned Dataset
1. Download the **"dataset_songs.csv"** file onto your laptop.
2. Open RStudio and set the folder containing the "dataset_songs.csv" file as your working directory
3. Start running the code from **Step 7** as no need to merge or clean the data
4. Follow through each step to run the code and complete the analysis 
   
### Option 2: Merging The Raw CSV Files
1. Download the relevant files onto your laptop: **"official_songs_cleaned.csv"**, **"official_is_pop_cleaned.csv"**, **"acoustic_features.csv"** and **"artists_cleaned .csv"**
